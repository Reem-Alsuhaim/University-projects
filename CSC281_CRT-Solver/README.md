# CSC281 - Linear Congruences Solver (CRT)

This project was developed as part of CSC281: DISCRETE MATHEMATICS FOR COMPUTER SCIENCE at King Saud University.  
It focuses on implementing a solver for **linear congruences** using the **Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT)**. 


## Features
- Solves equations of the form:   a * x ≡ b (mod m)

- Verifies that all moduli are pairwise relatively prime.
- Eliminates coefficients when needed.
- Uses modular inverses to compute the solution.

## How it works
1. Enter the number of congruences.
2. Input each equation as three integers: `a b m`.
3. The program calculates and prints the general solution in the form:   x ≡ result (mod M)
