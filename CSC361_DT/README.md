# Diabetes Prediction using Decision Tree (J48)

This project was developed as part of **CSC361  : Artificial intelligence** at King Saud University.  
It implements a **Decision Tree classifier (J48 â€“ C4.5 algorithm)** using **Weka** in Java to predict diabetes outcomes.

---

##  Project Description
The program:
1. Loads the **diabetes dataset** (`.csv` file).
2. Handles missing values and converts the outcome column to **nominal** (required by J48).
3. Splits the dataset into **70% training** and **30% testing**.
4. Trains a **Decision Tree (J48)** classifier.
5. Evaluates the model and prints:
   - Decision tree structure
   - Confusion matrix (TP, FP, FN, TN)
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score
